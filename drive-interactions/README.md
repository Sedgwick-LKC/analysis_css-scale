# Google Drive Interactions

It is convenient for La Kretz Center (LKC) staff to use the versions of the data stored in the internal Shared Google Drive. However, no one outside of the LKC has access to that Drive and thus including these scripts in the 'actual' analysis/visualization scripts would render those scripts inoperable for anyone but LKC staff (which is not terribly reproducible). Eventually these data will be archived in a FAIR data repository but for the moment, this folder exists to silo useful operations for the convenience of LKC staff.
